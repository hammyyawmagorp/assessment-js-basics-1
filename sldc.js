// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements.
// Design.
// Implementation.
// Maintain
// Planning.
// Testing & Integration.

//Answer:
let answer = ['Planning', 'Analysis of requirements' , 'Design','Testing & Integration','Implementation','Maintain']

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Discuss what need to be built, details on how it should work, and information on how users will be able to use it. ";
const design = "A model for the way a software application will work."
const testingAndIntegration = " Writing the program and testing it as we go, checking it agaisnt the planning and requirements. Testing will help reduce the number of bugs and better implementation.";
const implementation = "Implementing the program after testing. Performance is compared to the objectives established during planning. Includes installation of software and integration into daily work processes.";
const maintain = "Maintenance is necessary while system operations are ongoing. The system must be monitored for performance.";
